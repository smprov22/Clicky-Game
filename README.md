This is a React app with a little Bootstrap and additional CSS styling added in.  

The object of this game is to try and click on each image only one time.  I themed the game after the Weasley family from the Harry Potter films.  They can be hard to distinghish, especially the twins, so I figured it would add a slight challenge to the game.  If you click on the same Weasley more than once, an alert pops up to let you know you lost the game.  If your current score is higher than the high score, your score will become the high score.  If not, the high score remains the same.  If you manage to only click each image a single time, an alert will pop up letting you know you won the game.
